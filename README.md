# FoodOrderApp
In this project I have buildt a single paged food ordering app with react and firebase

You can access the project via http://food-order-app-3bd04.web.app/

The speciality of this project is as I mentioned earlier it's a single page app and I have used context API to menage those pages and cart like gloabal resources in the project.

Also to do form validation I have used a custom input validation hook and you can find it under the hooks folder.

Highly Appreciate Your Suggestions.

Thank You!!
